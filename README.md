# T-Budget

T-Budget is a free, privacy-focused app I developed to help my wife and me track our expenses. There’s no remote component or data collection—everything stays securely on your device.

While intentionally simple, the app includes all the essential features:

- View expense summaries by week and month
- Use a fixed set of categories
- Easily add and delete expenses
- Set a monthly budget for each category
- Visualize your spending for the current period with a pie chart
- Enjoy robust support for app interoperability via Shortcuts

You can also import and export your data effortlessly using the built-in Shortcuts actions, making it simple to stay on top of your budget.

The app is open source, and I welcome contributions!

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I export data from the app to Excel for further analysis of my expenses?<br>
**A**: Absolutely! The app provides Shortcuts actions that export a CSV file for the current month, as well as a CSV file for data between two specific dates. This makes it easy to analyze your expenses in Excel or other tools.

**Q**: Can I get a reminder to add an expense whenever I pay with my phone?
**A**: Sure! You can create a Shortcut that adds an "Add Expense to T-Budget" action whenever you close your payment app (for example, Satyspay). This way, you’ll be prompted to log your expense right after each purchase.
